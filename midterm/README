========================

Similar to my submission for homework 2 the directory `man1/` contains the man
page given as the spec for the program, and I have left my debugging statements
in my code (these can be activated by defining 'DEBUG' at compile time, which
the Makefile target 'debug' will do).

I have attempted the extra credit for this assignment. I didn't finish getting
`-C` to work, but it handles when all items fit on one row (matches `-x` in this
case), all other cases it prints the items in one column like `-1`. With this
functionality I thought it safe to leave that as the default when executing from
a terminal, please specify the `-1` option to see the specified
(non-extra-credit) behavior.

I did not have time to check the `-F` option, and I did not have time to make
the program print aligned columns for the `-l`, `-x` and `-C` options.
