========================

The directory `man1/` contains man pages (transcribed from the given) of the
spec for the programs, the plan was to have the Makefile install the man pages
but I ran out of time to figure out an unpriviledged (i.e. non root) install
process for the man pages. Nevertheless they are left included in my submission
and can be viewed using `man -l <file>`.

The included Makefile will define `BUF_SIZE` to be the result of `stat -c "%o"
Makefile` at compile time in order to have a (somewhat) portable scheme for
determining the efficient I/O size, this will probably fail on non-GNU systems
for two reasons:

    1. it makes use of (GNU) make's `shell` builtin
    2. the `stat` command that it runs uses the GNU/Linux format options

However, this too is included in my submission because it runs on the linux-lab
and the Makefile was an optional component for the assignment. If compiling
without the Makefile `BUF_SIZE` can be defined at compile time, but if it is not
a default value of 4096 was chosen.

Finally, my source code contains various "debugging" statements surrounded by
preprocessor conditionals checking for `DEBUG`. There is an included Makefile
target ("debug") which will enable these statements, they are included in my
submission to show that I have done (at least some) testing on my code.
